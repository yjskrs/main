== Introduction

Sick of having tracking your university progress the manual way?
Start getting rid of your Excel sheets and scribbled down notes and download _iGrad_ right now!

What is _iGrad_?

_iGrad_ is the app to track your university progress, for students who are frustrated with the
limited features the university provides, by students who are frustrated by the limited
features the university provides.

_iGrad_ offers users the ability to create custom courses and graduation requirements,
ensuring the *maximum* degree of flexibility when planning and keeping track of your progress

_iGrad_ also retrieves data directly from https://nusmods.com[NUS Mods], ensuring that module
information is always up to date.

_iGrad_ calculates your CAP at every step, ensuring you never have to use a CAP calculator again

Finally, the _iGrad_ team is always open to feedback and suggestions from the public which
will always be followed up on.

== How to use this guide

You may proceed to <<Command List>> if you would like to learn how to use each of the commands, and <<Cheat Sheet>>
if you would just like a list of all the commands for easy reference.

== Features

Section by: https://github.com/nathanaelseen[Nathanael Seen]

This segment highlights three key features iGrad offers to NUS students, namely;
a Course Planner, an MCs Tracker, and a CAP Tracker.

If you would like a more in-depth overview of the actual components of our application, please
refer to the next section; <<Components>>, for more details.

==== Course Planner
_iGrad_ was built with every NUS student in mind. Our flexible course planner allows you to plan
a course of your own dreams, be it those of you doing a single degree programme,
a double degree programme, and even a concurrent degree programme.

With our course planner, you would be able to enter your current course details such as your
*modules* and the various degree *requirements* by which those modules are mapped.

(For instance, the _Computer Science_ course has the various
*modules*, highlighted in [blue]#blue#, and degree *requirements*, boxed in [red]#red#):

anchor:figure-a-anchor[]

.Computer science degree requirements
image::../images/user-guide/components/graduation_degree_requirements.png[]

==== MCs Tracker

We are sick of counting our MCs at the beginning of every semester; be it counting the
total course MCs left before you can graduate, or tracking the number of MCs left
for those invidual degree requirements (boxed in [green]#green#,
in xref:figure-a-anchor[_Figure 1_]).

With our MCs feature, you would be able to easily keep track of how close you are to
graduation, as all this information is automatically updated and recomputed, each time you have
completed a certain module.

==== CAP Tracker
No more googling for CAP calculators. iGrad's CAP tracker helps you keeps track of your current CAP at
every step of your journey in your course. In addition, it even offers predictive features so you know how
well you have to do in order to achieve your dream CAP.

==== Everything Integrated into One Application
But the best part is that these features are all integrated into our application; _iGrad_.
And with all these important pieces of information in one place, you would never go amiss keeping
track of all your graduation requirements.

== Components
This segment details the various components of _iGrad_. As shown in _Figure 2_ below,
these components follow a hierachical structure, exactly like how an NUS course is structured.

anchor:figure-b-anchor[]

.Hierachical overview of iGrad components
image::../images/user-guide/components/hierachical_structure.png[]

Here is how our application looks like (on a typical usage):

.iGrad application screenshot
image::../images/user-guide/components/app_screenshot_ui.png[]

The following is the same screenshot of our application, but with the various components
of our application highlighted:

.iGrad components screenshot
image::../images/user-guide/components/app_screenshot_ui_components_highlighted.png[]

As per the screenshot above (in _figure 4_):

* xref:Course[Course] is indicated in [blue]#blue#,
* xref:Degree Requirements[Degree Requirements] is indicated in [red]#red#, and
* xref:Modules[Modules] is indicated in [yellow]#yellow#

You may refer to xref:figure-b-anchor[_Figure 2_], if you would like a quick recap on the
hierarchical structuring of these components.

==== Course

A course is simply a group of degree requirements.

It contains important information such as your current CAP, total number of MCs
you have completed thus far, and semesters left before you can graduate.

In short, it helps you keep track of your overall degree progress.

==== Degree Requirements

Under a course are the various degree requirements, such as the ones shown in
xref:figure-b-anchor[_Figure 2_] above; _Computer Science Foundation_,
_Mathematics and Sciences_, and _Unrestricted Electives_.

Each requirement comprises of the modules you need to complete in order to fulfill that particular
requirement.

Additionally, each requirement consists of important information such as
the number of MCs you have already fulfilled.

==== Modules

Finally, modules are the basic building block of all the other components.

These could be modules you have taken, modules you are currently taking and modules that
you plan to take.

Each module allows recording of other optional information, such as indicating the grade you
have obtained for those modules.

== Command List
This section provides a detailed breakdown of the various commands you may use in iGrad,
by typing the commands into the command box.
Please read <<Command Format>> to understand how our commands work!

=== Command Format
This section explains the syntax for the commands in iGrad. You may move onto <<Course>> if you are already
familiar with our syntax which involves the command word(s), prefixes, parameters, specifiers and flags.

The table below summarises the components of our syntax, using `module` commands as example.

[#tableCommandFormatComponents]
.Command Format Components
|===
|Component |Description |Example

|Command Word(s) |Command words tell iGrad what command you are trying to perform. |E.g. `module add`.
|Prefix |Prefixes tell iGrad what kind of information you are trying to key in.
A prefix consists of an alphabet followed by a forward slash (i.e. `/`).
|E.g. `t/` is the prefix for `TITLE`.
|Parameter |Parameters tell iGrad the information you want to key in. Parameters come directly
after a prefix, and you can chain prefix-parameters pairs.
|E.g. In `t/TITLE`, `TITLE` is the parameter where you can key in your desired title.
|Specifier |Specifiers inform iGrad of the item you want to edit or delete. To differentiate them from the
properties of the item you are trying to modify, they do not come with prefixes.
|E.g. In the `module edit CS2103T t/Hardware Engineering` command, `CS2103T` is the module we are trying to edit,
and `Hardware Engineering` is what we want to set as the new module title.
|Flag |Flags tell iGrad to use a different version of the command.
Flags consist of a dash (i.e. `-`) followed by an alphabet.
Flags can only be indicated at the end of the command.
|E.g. `module add n/CS2101 -a` adds a module by pulling its data from NUSMods.
|===

We have also listed all the parameters and their corresponding prefixes in the table below.

[#tableParameterPrefixPairs]
.Parameter Prefix Pairs
|===
|Parameter | Prefix

|`NAME` or `CODE`|`n/`
|`TITLE`|`t/`
|`CREDITS`|`u/`
|`SEMESTER`|`s/`
|`GRADE`|`g/`
|`CAP`|`c/`
|===

The two flags used in iGrad are listed in the table below.

[#tableFlags]
.Flags
|===
|Flag | Purpose
|`-a`| Informs iGrad to use automated module adding by pulling data of modules from NUSMods. Only used in the xref:ModuleAutoAddCommand[ModuleAutoAdd] command.
|`-o`| Informs iGrad to use the or option when filtering modules. Only used in the xref:ModuleFilterCommand[ModuleFilter] command.
|===

=== Help
This command opens up a help window for easy reference on the list of commands that can be used in iGrad.
A link is also provided to link back to the user guide for more detailed explanations.

[#tableHelpQuickReference]
.Help Quick Reference
|===
|Purpose | Opens a help window with a list of commands
|Syntax| `help`
|Example | `help`
|===

=== Course
This section details each command used in manipulating the course. All course commands begin with the identifier
`course`, followed by the action, e.g. `set`.

All course commands use the same parameters, as listed in the table below:
[#tableCourseParameters]
.Course Parameters
|===
|Name| Description | Example | Restrictions

|`COURSE_TITLE`| The course title | Computer Science |-
|`SEMESTER`| The total number of semesters you will be spending in NUS | 8 |-
|===

==== Course Set

==== Course Edit

==== Course Delete

=== Requirement
This section details each command used in manipulating requirements. All requirement commands begin with the identifier
`requirement`, followed by the action, e.g. `add`.

All requirement commands use the same parameters, as listed in the table below:

[#tableRequirementParameters]
.Requirement Parameters
|===
|Name| Description | Example | Restrictions

|`REQUIREMENT_CODE`| A requirement's unique identifier, auto generated by iGrad based on the requirement title | CSF0 |-
|`REQUIREMENT_TITLE`| A requirement's title | Computer Science Foundation |-
|`REQUIREMENT_CREDITS`| The number of http://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/academic-information-policies/graduate/modular-system[modular credits] needed to fulfill the requirement | 32 | Must be a positive number less than or equals to 10,000
|===

==== Requirement Add

==== Requirement Edit

==== Requirement Delete

==== Requirement Assign

==== Requirement Unassign

// tag::module[]
=== Module

This section details each command used to manipulate modules. All module commands begin with the identifier
`module` followed by the action e.g. `add`.

All module commands use the same parameters, listed in the table below:

[#tableModuleParameters]
.Module Parameters
|===
|Name| Description | Example | Restrictions

|`MODULE_CODE` | A module's unique identifier | CS2103T | Must have two letters in the front, four numbers in the middle with an optional letter at the back
|`MODULE_TITLE`| A module's title | Software Engineering |-
|`MODULE_CREDITS`| The number of http://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/academic-information-policies/graduate/modular-system[modular credits] a module is worth | 4 | Must be a number
|`SEMESTER`| An academic semester. There are two semesters in a year | Y1S1 | Must be in the format Y?S* where ? represents a digit from 0 - 4 and * represents a digit from 1 -2
|`GRADE` | A module's grade | A+ | Must be one of the following:  A+, A, A-, B+, B-, C+, C, D, D+, F, S, U |
|===

If, when issuing a command, the parameter restrictions are not strictly adhered to,
you might come across some common errors.
The following errors are generic and may be encountered when dealing with any module command:

[#tableModuleParametersErrorReference]
.Module Parameters Error Reference
|===
|Parameter|Error Name

|`MODULE_CODE`| Invalid Module Code
|`MODULE_CREDITS`| Invalid Module Credits
|`SEMESTER`| Invalid Semester
|`GRADE`| Invalid Grade
|===

These errors can all be resolved by adhering to the restrictions detailed in <<tableModuleParameters>>

[#ModuleAddCommand]
==== Module Add

This command adds a module to the module list.

[#ModuleAddQuickReference]
.Module Add Quick Reference
|===
|Purpose | Adds a module
|Syntax| `module add n/MODULE_CODE t/MODULE_TITLE u/MODULE_CREDITS [s/SEMESTER]`
|Example | `module add n/CS2103T t/Software Engineering u/4 s/Y1S1`
|===

*How it Works*

When you type in this command, we take the given values for the `MODULE_CODE`, `MODULE_TITLE`, `MODULE_CREDITS` and optionally, the `SEMESTER`,
and fill in those fields. We do not check if the given `MODULE_CODE` or `MODULE_TITLE` refer to actual modules offered by NUS. However, the restrictions stated in the module parameters table still apply.

<<ModuleAddErrorReference>> lists errors you might encounter after issuing this command:

[#ModuleAddErrorReference]
.Module Add Error Reference
|===
|Name | Message| Explanation| Solution

|Duplicate Module Error | Duplicate Detected| The module you are attempting to add already exists in the module list| Delete the existing module in the list and try again|
|===


*Tutorial*

Follow these steps to get a clearer idea of how this command works
[NOTE]
For this tutorial, actual values will be given instead of placeholders. Undo or Delete objects created from this tutorial by using the appropriate commands


1. Check that you do not have the modules with `MODULE_CODE` CS2103T and CS2101 in your list of modules

2. Type the following into the command box
`module add n/CS2103T u/4 t/Software Engineering` and press enter

3.  Type the following into the command box
`module add n/CS2101 u/4 t/Effective Communication for Computing Professionals` and press enter

4. The message in the response box should change and you should see the following in the module panel:

+
.Modules CS2103T and CS2101 successfully added
image::../images/user-guide\moduleAutoAddCommand\two_modules.png[]

[#ModuleAutoAddCommand]
==== Module Auto Add

This command adds a module to the module list. The module information is taken
from the https://api.nusmods.com/[NUSMods API] and includes the `MODULE_CODE`, `MODULE_TITLE`
and `MODULE_CREDITS`.

[#ModuleAutoAddQuickReference]
.Module Auto Add Quick Reference
|===
|Purpose | Adds a module from NUSMods
|Syntax| `module add n/MODULE_CODE_A n/MODULE_CODE_B -a`
|Example | `module add n/CS2103T n/CS2101 -a`
|===

*How it Works*

IMPORTANT: Do not miss out the `-a` flag

When you type in this command, a request is made to https://api.nusmods.com/[NUSMods API]. More specifically, we visit the
module page and ask for the information provided there. An example page can be found https://api.nusmods.com/2018-2019/modules/CS2103T/[here].

[NOTE]
We try to get the module information from the current academic year. However,
this might not always be possible as NUS might not have released
the module details. As a contingency, we retrieve the module information from the
previous academic year.

In general, using this command speeds up the process of module addition greatly. However, as we have to make
a request to an external webpage, the time taken to process the request might be considerably longer.

[WARNING]
After issuing the command, the app might seem to freeze. Not to worry! It is merely processing your request. Please be patient when executing this command, especially when attempting to add a large number of modules.

This command also supports _batch processing_ and you can add multiple modules, with the necessary information all
filled in, by issuing a single command. In the case where adding a single module in a batch of modules raises an error,
we skip that module and let you know what went wrong.

[TIP]
You can add up to 10 modules at once! Try this: `module add n/CS1101 n/CS1231 n/CS2030 n/CS2040 n/CS2100 n/CS2103T n/CS2105 n/CS2106 n/CS3230 n/CS3219 -a`

<<ModuleAutoAddErrorReference>> lists the errors you might encounter after issuing this command:

[#ModuleAutoAddErrorReference]
.Module Auto Add Error Reference
|===
|Name| Message| Explanation |Solution

|Duplicate Module Error | Duplicate Detected| The module you are attempting to add already exists in the module list| Delete the existing module in the list and try again
|Module Not Found Error| Module Not Found| The module you are attempting to add could not be found on the NUSMods API |  Use the command <<ModuleAddCommand>> instead
|Module Overload Error | Module Overload Error|You attemped to add too many modules. The limit is 10| Divide the list of modules into smaller batches of size less than 10 and try again
|Connection Error I | Connection Error| You are not connected to the internet| Whilst all other commands work offline. You need an internet connection to issue this command. Go online before trying again
|Connection Error II | Connection Error| The NUSMods API server is down| Use the command module add instead or wait until the NUSMods API server is restored
|===

*Tutorial*

Follow these steps to get a clearer idea of how this command works

[NOTE]
For this tutorial, actual values will be given instead of placeholders. Undo or Delete objects created from this tutorial by using the appropriate commands

1. Check that you do not have the modules with `MODULE_CODE` CS2103T and CS2101 in your list of modules

2. Type the following into the command box
`module add n/CS2103T n/CS2101 -a` and press enter

3. Wait for up to 5 seconds

4. The message in the response box should change and you should see the following in the module panel

+
.Modules CS2103T and CS2101 successfully added from NUSMods
image::../images/user-guide\moduleAutoAddCommand\two_modules.png[]

*Additional Information*

We are also able to retrieve information pertaining to a module's prerequisites and preclusions. However, as our app can function as a module planner
in addition to tracking your graduation requirements, we do not prevent you from adding modules that have unfulfilled prerequisites but instead, simply show a warning.

WARNING: As the prerequisites and preclusions from NUSMods do not follow any standard formatting, the warning messages shown might not
always be accurate. This is due to a difficulty of interpreting
the data given by NUSMods. This remains a BETA feature and we hope to upgrade it in time.

==== Module Done

This command marks a module as done by giving it a grade and optionally, a semester.

.Module Done Quick Reference
|===
|Purpose | Marks a module as done
|Syntax| `module done MODULE_CODE g/GRADE [s/SEMESTER]`
|Example | `module done CS2103T g/A s/Y1S1`
|===

*How it Works*

When you issue the command, we give your module the grade, and optionally the semester, that you provided. This helps us keep track of both your CAP and the number
of semesters you have left before graduating.

In order to calculate your CAP, we use a known algorithm which is guaranteed to be accurate. To see what semester you are currently at, we
take the latest semester given to a module which has been marked as done. From that, we are able to tell you how many semesters you have left.

[NOTE]
We do not currently allow the input of special terms. As a workaround, for modules taken
during special term, you could input the most recent semester instead

<<ModuleDoneErrorReference>> lists the errors you might encounter after issuing this command:

[#ModuleDoneErrorReference]
.Module Done Error Reference
|===
|Name| Message| Explanation |Solution

|Module Not Found Error | Module Not Found| The module you are attempting to mark as done does not exist in the module list| Add the module you wish to mark as done and try again
|===

Ensure that you have the module CS2103T in the module list

1. Type the following into the command box `module done CS2103T g/A s/Y4S1`

2. The message in the response box should change and you should see the following

+
.Modules CS2103T successfully given a grade and a semester
image::../images/user-guide\moduleAutoAddCommand\one_module.png[]

==== Module Edit

This command edits the editable fields in a module which include the `MODULE_TITLE`, `MODULE_CREDITS`, `SEMESTER`.
Although it is possible to edit the fields as listed, it is unadvisable unless you made a mistake while keying
in the values.

.Module Edit Quick Reference
|===
|Purpose | Edits a module
|Syntax| `module edit MODULE_CODE [t/MODULE_TITLE] [u/MODULE_CREDITS] [s/SEMESTER]`
|Example | `module edit CS2103T t/Hardware Engineering u/8 s/Y1S2`
|===

*How it Works*

When you issue the command, we replace the fields provided with the given values. You are able to
change the values as you wish as long as they follow the restrictions as listed in the parameters table.

<<ModuleEditErrorReference>> lists the errors you might encounter after issuing this command:

[#ModuleEditErrorReference]
.Module Edit Error Reference
|===
|Name| Message| Explanation |Solution

|Module Not Found Error | Module Not Found| The module you are attempting to edit does not exist in the module list| Instead of editing a module that does not exist, try adding a new one!

==== Module Delete

This command deletes a module from the module list.

.Delete Quick Reference
|===
|Purpose | Deletes a module
|Syntax| `module delete MODULE_CODE`https://xxx[]
|Example | `module delete CS2103T`
|===

*How it Works*

The module that you wish to delete is completely removed from the module list.
[WARNING]
Restoring the module is only possible using the `undo` command which would only work if `delete` was the last issued command.

<<ModuleDeleteErrorReference>> lists the errors you might encounter after issuing this command:

[#ModuleDeleteErrorReference]
.Module Delete Error Reference
|===
|Name| Message| Explanation |Solution

|Module Not Found Error | Module Not Found| The module you are attempting to delete does not exist in the module list| Your problem is your solution!
|===

Ensure that you have the module CS2103T in the module list

1. Type the following into the command box `module delete CS2103T`

2. The message in the response box should change and you should see that the module CS2103T disappears from the module list

[#ModuleFilterCommand]
==== Module Filter

This command allows you to find your modules by various parameters. You can filter the
complete module list by `SEMESTER`, `MODULE_CREDITS` and `GRADE`.

.Filter Quick Reference
|===
|Purpose | Displays a module list filtered based on the given parameters
|Syntax| `module filter [s/SEMESTER] [u/MODULE_CREDITS] [g/GRADE] [-o]`
|Example | `module filter s/Y1S1 u/4 g/A -o`
|===

*How it Works*

Two options are provided for you:

[Option 1] Displays modules that match all provided parameters

or

[Option 2] Displays modules that match at least one of the provided parameters.

If the flag `-o` is included at the end of the command, Option 2 will be chosen. Otherwise, the default option is Option 1.

IMPORTANT: In order to display all modules once again, simply type `module filter`. This will display an unfiltered module list containing all modules.

There are no notable errors to list. If wrong parameters are given, the app will simply
display the unfiltered module list. However, you should always take note of what filters are currently in place. If you
are unable to find some modules after using this command, please reset the display by typing in `module filter`.

WARNING: If you
are unable to find some modules after using this command, please reset the display by typing in `module filter`.

*Tutorial*

Ensure that the following modules are in the module list:
|===
|Module Code| Credits|Semester| Grade

|CS2103T|4|Y1S1|A
|CS2101|4|Y1S2|B
|CS2040|6|Y2S1|C
|===

 . Type `module filter u/4` into the command box
 . The message in the response box should change and you should see the modules CS2103T and CS2101 in the module panel

 .. Retrieving modules which have either `SEMESTER` Y1S2 or `GRADE` C
. Type `module filter s/Y1S1 g/B -o`
. The message in the response box should change and you should see the modules CS2101 and CS2040 in the module panel


*Additional Information*

[NOTE]
This section contains information which requires prior knowledge of discrete mathematics or more specifically, logical operators

The flag `-o`, is present, sets the logical operator used in concatenating the parameters as _"or"_. The default logical operator used is _"and"_.
// end::module[]
'''

=== Export

This command exports your data to a comma-separated values (.csv) file. This file can then be submitted to the relevant
administration for processing of Leave of Absence (LOA), exchange programmes or internship applications.

.Export Quick Reference
|===
|Purpose | Exports your data to a .csv file
|Syntax| `export`
|Example | `export`
|===

*How it Works*

We write your data to a .csv file _study_plan.csv_ using the modules you have added and include the fields `MODULE_CODE`, `MODULE_TITLE`, `SEMESTER` and `CREDITS`.

.Study Plan Example CSV
image::../images/user-guide\exportCommand\export_csv_example.png[]

NOTE: Modules that have not been tagged with a semester will not be written

After issuing the command, you will be able to find the file in the same folder as the app's executable.

NOTE: For example, if the app is stored in your Desktop folder, the file _study_plan.csv_ will be created in the Desktop folder as well

## FAQs

_I'm not an NUS student. Can I still use iGrad?_

As long as your university follows a similar <<fig-2,hierachical structure>>!
However, we will be unable to provide features such as validation from NUSMods.

_Do I require an online connection to use iGrad?_

Nope! iGrad may be used offline. However, our validation feature which utilises NUSMods would be unavailable,
and you'll have to key in your module details manually.

_Where can I get the icons for the avatars?_

Avatar pictures were obtained from https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/hand-drawn-kawaii-characters-collection_4098554.htm#page=1&query=cute%20animals&position=2[Freepik].
