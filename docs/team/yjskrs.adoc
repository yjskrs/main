== Overview

iGrad is a desktop module management and graduation tracking application. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX, FXML and CSS.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added the *architecture for requirements*, integrating the requirement feature with the course feature and the module feature*.
** _What it does_: Provides the requirement structure where modules can be assigned to, to keep track of the progress of a requirement.
** _Justification_: This feature is crucial in providing the ability for users to keep track of their graduation status through smaller categories known as requirements, instead of directly under a course.
** _Highlights_: This enhancement greatly increases the usability of the application because it makes course completion easier to track. It was also difficult to integrate this together with the course feature and the module feature since the code for this feature had to be written from scratch.
** _Credits_: The original AB3 code which I referenced from the AddressBook structure as well as the Person structure to create this feature.

* *Major enhancement*: Added the *ability to add, edit and delete requirements*.
** _What it does_: Allows the user to add, edit and delete requirements.

** _Highlights_:
** _Credits_: The original AB3 code which I referenced to create the commands.
