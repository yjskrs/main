[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::developer-guide/ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App.
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/igrad/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/igrad/MainApp.java[`MainApp`].
It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of five components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.
* <<Design-Services,*`Services`*>>: Interacts with an external Application Programming Interface (API) to obtain data for the App.

Each of the first four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `module delete CS1010` command
image::developer-guide/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

//tag::ui[]
[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::developer-guide/UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/igrad/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

Section by: https://github.com/dargohzy[Daryl]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ModuleListPanel`, `StatusBar` etc.
All these, including the `MainWindow` (excluding `AvatarImage`), inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework.
The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.
For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/igrad/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`].

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

==== MainWindow

The `MainWindow` class serves as the hub for all the UI components, and contains the following UI classes:

* `AvatarSelectionPanel` - Avatar selection screen on first-time startup.
* `CommandBox` - Command box for user input.
* `CommandReceivedPanel` - Displays the last command entered.
* `ResultDisplay` - Displays the resultant message of the command entered. Also contains the avatar image.
* `ModuleListPanel` - Panel displaying the modules input into the system.
* `RequirementListPanel` - Panel displaying the requirements input into the system.
* `ProgressSidePanel` - Panel displaying the user's academic progress and fundamental details (Eg. CAP).

The `MainWindow` coordinates the development between the backend and frontend components to induce a visible change to the interface.

This is done through the `executeCommand(String commandText, Model model)` method. Upon user input, the `logic` class
executes the command in `commandText`, and the model is updated to reflect the changes. Subsequently, after the model
has been updated, the following UI classes `ResultDisplay` and `ProgressSidePanel` are refreshed as a result.

==== AvatarSelectionPanel

The `AvatarSelectionPanel` class displays the avatar selection screen upon first-time startup. Users will choose an
that will act as a guide throughout their usage of the application.

==== CommandBox

The `CommandBox` class contains an editable `TextArea` JavaFX component which allows the user to enter input commands.

==== CommandReceivedPanel
The `CommandReceivedPanel` class contains a panel that shows the last command entered into the system.

Here is an example of how the `CommandReceivedPanel` works:
[[fig-CommandReceivedPanelSequenceDiagram]]
.CommandReceivedPanel Updating from Received Command

image::developer-guide/CommandReceivedSetCommand.png[]

. Command executed on `MainWindow`.
. `MainWindow` calls the method `refreshCommandReceivedPanel`, which refreshes the `CommandReceivedPanel`.
. `CommandReceivedPanel` updates its JavaFX `Label` with the `String` of the command given.
. `CommandReceivedPanel` displays visible change on the interface.
. `refreshCommandReceivedPanel` ends execution.

==== ResultDisplay
The `ResultDisplay` class shows the resultant message generated from the user's input.
The avatar will also showcase a different expression according to the success of the command given.

Here is an example of how the `ResultDisplay` works:
[[fig-ResultDisplaySequenceDiagram]]
.ResultDisplay Updating from Received Command

image::developer-guide/ResultDisplayHandleCommand.png[]

. Command executed on `MainWindow`.
. `MainWindow` calls the method `refreshResultDisplayAvatar`, which refreshes the `Avatar` in `ResultDisplay`.
. `ResultDisplay` updates its JavaFX `ImageView` according to the `Avatar` of the command given. In this case, when no
exception is thrown, the `Avatar` displays that of a positive expression.
. `refreshResultDisplayAvatar` ends execution.
. `ResultDisplay` displays visible change on the interface.
. `MainWindow` calls the method `refreshResultDisplay`, which refreshes the resultant message displayed in `ResultDisplay`.
. `ResultDisplay` updates its JavaFX `TextArea` according to the `CommandResult` of the command given. In this case, the
TextArea will display the 'success' message generated as a result of the command.
. `ResultDisplay` displays visible change on the interface.
. `refreshResultDisplay` ends execution.

==== ModuleListPanel
The `ModuleListPanel` class contains the `ObservableList<Module>`  JavaFX component allowing for a list view of the
components inside it, in this case, a list of `ModuleCard` objects.

The contents of the list are dependent on the `modules` that the user has input into the system. Each module will be
displayed as a `ModuleCard` object.

==== RequirementListPanel
The `RequirementListPanel` class contains the `ObservableList<Requirement` JavaFX component allowing for a list view of
the components inside it, in this case, a list of `RequirementCard` objects.

The contents of the list are dependent on the `requirements` that the user has input into the system. Each requirement
will be displayed as a `RequirementCard` object.

==== ProgressSidePanel
The `ProgressSidePanel` class contains the user's academic progress, as well as essential information. The following
information is displayed on the `ProgressSidePanel`:

* `Course` name
* Inspiring quote from `QuoteGenerator`
* Modular Credits Progress Indicator
* `Semesters` left
* Current Cumulative Average Point (C.A.P)

Here is an example of how the `ProgressSidePanel` works:

[[fig-ProgressPanelUpdateProgress]]
.ProgressSidePanel Updating from Received Command

image::developer-guide/ProgressPanelUpdateProgress.png[]

. Command executed on `MainWindow`.
. `Model` is updated.
. `MainWindow` calls the method `refreshProgressPanel`, which refreshes the `ProgressSidePanel`.
. `ProgressSidePanel` uses `Model` to obtain the corresponding `CourseInfo` information:
.. `Name`
.. `Credits`
.. `Cap`
.. `Semesters`
. `ProgressSidePanel` executes corresponding JavaFX methods to update displayed information.
. `ProgressSidePanel` shows visible change on the interface.
. `refreshProgressPanel` ends execution.

==== Other Components
In addition to the main UI components grouped in the `MainWindow` class, these are the other UI components that are
relevant to the interface:

* `AvatarImage` - Contains the image of the avatar.
* `ModuleCard` - Individual card containing the relevant information of the module. List of `ModuleCard` contained in the `ModuleListPanel`.
* `RequirementCard` - Individual card containing the relevant information of the requirement. List of `RequirementCards`  contained in the `RequirementListPanel`.
* `HelpWindow` - Pop-up window containing the link the User Guide, as well as a list of all the commands in the application.

//end::ui[]

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::developer-guide/LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/igrad/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

. `Logic` uses the `CourseBookParser` class to parse the user command.
. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a module).
. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::developer-guide/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `ModuleDeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::developer-guide/ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/igrad/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Course Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Requirement>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Module>` that can be 'observed'.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Course Book`, which `Module` can reference.
This would allow `Course Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Module` needing their own `Tag` object.
An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:developer-guide/BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::developer-guide/StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/igrad/memo/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Course Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `iGrad.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Course Feature

A `CourseBook` contains only one course information.

==== Implementation

.Structure of CourseInfo Class
image::developer-guide/CourseInfoClassDiagram.png[]
A course consists of three information: Name, CAP, and SemsLeft. One course should only have one name,
and one CAP.

The course related commands that can be called are:

* `course edit` - edits name of existing course in the course book
* `course delete` - deletes existing course and all information in the course book
* `course achieve` - calculates CAP needed to maintain each semester to achieve overall CAP targer

Here is how the courseInfo class updates when name of course is edited:

.Sequence Diagram when editing course name.
image::developer-guide/CourseEditSequenceDiagram.png[]
When a user edits name of a course, the user has to specify the prefix `/n` for name.
Then the application proceeds to do the following steps:

Step 1: The CourseEditCommandParser is called to parse the CourseEditCommand with the n/ prefix.

Step 2: The CourseEditCommand is executed to set the new course name to the model.

Step 3: The new course name is set in the course book.

'''

//tag::module[]
=== Module Feature

==== Module Component

The `Module` component is the building block of all other components in the system.
In order to track the number of `credits` left to fulfill
for each `requirement`, each `module` is stored in a `UniqueModuleList` and the `credits` tied to each
`module` is then tabulated.

Besides being necessary in tracking the amount of credits left for a `requirement`, `modules` are also
used to decide which `semester` the user is currently in. When a `semester` is tagged to a `module`, either when
a new `module` is added or an existing `module` is edited, the latest `semester` of all `modules` in the `filteredList` of modules is taken
to be the current semester.

A module must have the following non-optional values:

|===
|Value Type|Class Name|Example

|String|Title|Software Engineering
|String|ModuleCode| CS2103T
|String| Credits| 4
|List|ModulePrerequisites| CS2030, CS2040
|List|ModulePreclusions| CS2103, CS2103T, CS2113T, CS2113
|===

A module may also have the following optional values:

|===
|Value Type|Class Name|Example

|String|Semester|Y3S1
|String|Grade| A+
|===

<<moduleClassDiagram>> illustrates the relation between the various classes:

[#moduleClassDiagram]
.Module Class Diagram
image::developer-guide/ModuleClassDiagram.png[]


==== Module Add Auto

===== Overview

The "automatic" addition of `modules` allows users to add up to 10 `modules` at once with all non-optional values filled in.
This is done by making a HTTP GET request to the https://api.nusmods.com/[NUSMods API] and fetching the module data
given in a JSON format.

===== Implementation

The automatic filling in of `module` details on addition of a new `module` is facilitated by `NusModsRequester`.
It creates a new instance of `GetRequestManager` which it relies on to make a request to the https://api.nusmods.com/[NUSMods API].
Upon receiving a response, it creates an instance of JsonParsedModule.

`JsonParsedModule` parses the JSON object given in the response of the initial request and stores the following values:

[#JsonParsedModuleTableOfValues]
.JsonParsedModule Table of Values
|===
|Value Type|Name|Example

|String|title|Software Engineering
|String|moduleCode|CS2103T
|String|credits|4
|String|prerequisite| CS2040C or (CS2030 and (CS2040 or its equivalent))
|String|preclusion| CS2103, CS2103T, (CS2113T for CS2113), (CS2113 for CS2113T)
|===

NOTE: <<JsonParsedModuleTableOfValues>> illustrates the difficulty in parsing `prerequisites` and `preclusions` as
the data provided is not in a standard format

The created `JsonParsedModule` object is then converted into a `Module` object, which is subsequently added
to the `courseBook` via the method `addModule` of the `ModelManager`.

<<moduleAddAutoSequenceDiagram>> illustrates this:

[#moduleAddAutoSequenceDiagram]
.Module Add Auto Sequence Diagram
image::developer-guide/ModuleAddAutoSequenceDiagram.png[]

===== Design Considerations

Most of the design considerations arose as a result of having to make a network request.

*A _secondary_ module addition feature*

As with all network requests, this feature might not work as intended in certain circumstances. Possible cases are:

1. High Network Congestion

2. Poor Network Connection

3. NUSMods Offline

In such situations, it becomes difficult or impossible to carry out the addition of `modules` using this command.
Therefore, this feature was built on top of the primary `module add` feature, ensuring that the user
could still manage to add `modules` even when faced with the issues as listed above.

The use case for this situation is as follows:

'''
System: iGrad

Use case: UCM1 - Add module via NUSMods

Actor: User, NUSMods

MSS:

1. User wants to add a module.

2. iGrad requires user to specify the module codes.

3. User enters the module codes corresponding to the modules
he wishes to add.

4. iGrad sends a request to NUSMods.

5. NUSMods responds with the requested data.

6. iGrad adds the module to the module list.

7. User views the module in the module list.

Use case ends.

Extensions:

5a. NUSMods does not respond with the requested data.

5a1. User adds module manually

[#moduleAutoAddUseCaseDiagram]
.Module Auto Add Use Case Diagram
image::developer-guide/ModuleAutoAddUseCaseDiagram.png[]

'''

*Messages for individual modules*

As this feature allows a user to add `modules` by batches, it is possible that one or more `modules` in
the batch are invalid or require warning messages. In order to facilitate this, the processing of the list of `modules` and the
generation of error and warning messages were done in parallel. This was because if the list of `modules` was processed first,
`modules` with issues would be filtered out without notice, leading to a confusing user experience.

[#moduleAddAutoBatchProcessing]
.Module Add Auto Batch Processing
image::developer-guide/ModuleAddAutoBatchActivityDiagram.png[]

*Improving the user experience [PROPOSED]*

Due to network latency - the Round Trip Time taken from when a request is made to when a response is
received - the user might experience a situation where it appears that the application has stopped working.

For a large batch of `modules`, the application might also display a _not responding_ label in the toolbar.
In order to improve the user experience, it is ideal that a loader be displayed when waiting for the response from the server.
However, due to time constraints, this was not implemented.

*Getting the latest data [DEPRECATED]*

Past iterations of this feature made a maximum of two requests for one `module`. The first request would
attempt to get the `module` for the current academic year, whilst the second request attempted to get
the `module` for the previous academic year, in the event the module for the current academic year was not available.

This process is illustrated in <<previousImplementationOfModuleAddAuto>>. However, it was decided
that the benefits of making a maximum of one request outweighed that of getting the latest module information and thus,
currently only one request is made.

[#previousImplementationOfModuleAddAuto]
.Previous implementation of Module Add Auto
image::developer-guide/ModuleAddAutoActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Module Filter

===== Overview

The average number of `modules` a student has for a 4 year program in NUS is 40. The application window, however, can display
a maximum of 9 `modules` for a 17" screen and considerably less for smaller displays. As a result, it is imperative that users have
a way to filter `modules` so that only what is required is displayed.

===== Implementation

The filtering of modules is done by calling the `execute` function of `ModuleFilterCommand`.`ModuleFilterCommand` takes in
optional parameters `Semester`, `Credits`, `Grade` and an operator, which could be `AND` or `OR`.

The matching is done by the functions `checkSemesterMatch(Module m)`, `checkCreditsMatch(Module m)` and `checkGradeMatch(Module m)`. Unlike
the other two functions, `checkCreditsMatch(Module m)` does not check if the actual `credits` for a module is present since the
`credits` field in a module is compulsory.

The `AND` operator specifies that the provided parameters be chained with the logical _and_ operator.

The `OR` operator specifies that provided parameters be chained with the logical _or_ operator.

When the filter command is issued, the `Model` updates the module list based on the predicate given. <<moduleFilterSequenceDiagram>>
illustrates this sequence of events:
[#moduleFilterSequenceDiagram]
.Module Filter Sequence Diagram
image::developer-guide/ModuleFilterSequenceDiagram.png[]

===== Design Considerations

*Resetting the state*

When this command is issued, the modules that do not match the predicate given will disappear from the module list.
It is thus necessary to allow the user to issue a new command in order to view all the modules again.

Whilst creating a new command such as `module reset` was proposed, it was decided that a new command would only serve to
make the user experience more complicated than it should be.

Therefore, an allowance was made for `module filter` to reset the state when receiving no parameters, a divergence from
the way other functions handled the situation of empty parameters.

<<moduleFilterActivityDiagram>> illustrates this clearly:

[#moduleFilterActivityDiagram]
.Module Filter Activity Diagram
image::developer-guide/ModuleFilterActivityDiagram.png[]

The `filteredList` of `modules` therefore takes three general states (see <<moduleFilterStateDiagram>>):

1. Initial State
+
The `module` list is unfiltered. All `modules` are displayed.

2. Filtered by `AND` State
+
The `module` list is filtered by a predicate composed of the provided parameters
chained together with the logical _and_ operator

3. Filtered by `OR` State
+
The `module` list is filtered by a predicate composed of the provided parameters
chained together with the logical _or_ operator

[#moduleFilterStateDiagram]
.Module Filter State Diagram
image::developer-guide/ModuleFilterStateDiagram.png[]

*Displaying Filter State [PROPOSED]*

An issue with the filtering of modules is that when the current state is not obvious, the
user might lose track of what the module list is filtering on. To solve this problem,
it would be an improvement to display the current state prominently to the user.
//end::module[]
'''

=== Requirements Feature
Within a course, there are multiple requirements to be tracked.

==== Implementation
.The Requirement class

.Structure of the Requirement class.
image::developer-guide/RequirementClassDiagram.png[]
A requirement consists of three components: title, credits and unique module list.
The unique module list implies that each requirement stores modules assigned to that requirement.
Multiple requirements can exist in the course book at any one time.

The requirement-related commands that can be called are:

* `requirement add` - adds a new requirement to the course book
* `requirement edit` - edits an existing requirement in the course book
* `requirement delete` - deletes an existing requirement from the course book
* `assign` - assigns a module to the requirement

Here is how the requirement class updates when a requirement is added:

.Sequence Diagram when adding a requirement.
image::developer-guide/RequirementAddSequenceDiagram.png[]

When the user adds a requirement, the user has to specify two prefixes: `n/` for title and `u/` for credits value (number of credits needed to fulfill for the requirement).
Then, the application proceeds to do the following steps

Step 1: The RequirementAddCommandParser is called to parse the RequirementAddCommand with the `n/` and the `u/` prefixes into a new requirement.

Step 2: The RequirementAddCommand is executed to add the new requirement to the model. In this step, the following check is performed:

* Check if a requirement with the same title already exists in the course book.

Step 3: The new requirement is added to the course book.


'''

=== Export Feature

==== Overview

The export feature allows the user to export their data into a .csv file.

==== Implementation

The export feature is facilitated by the `CsvWriter`. The `ExportCommand` calls `exportModuleList()` on `ModelManager`,
which then performs a filter on the `filteredList` of modules in order to filter out all modules where the `Optional<Semester>` object
`isEmpty()`.

The `ModelManager` allows for `write()` to be called on `CsvWriter` only if the `filteredList` has at least one module.

<<exportSequenceDiagram>> shows the process of exporting modules with semesters:

[#exportSequenceDiagram]
.Export Sequence Diagram
image::developer-guide/ExportSequenceDiagram.png[]

Once the `CsvWriter` returns from `write()`, a file titled _study_plan.csv_ will be created in the top-level directory.

The top-level directory has two states concerning the generated file (see <<exportStateDiagram>>):

1. Empty State
+
- does not contain the file study_plan.csv

2. Non-empty State
+
- contains the file study_plan.csv

[#exportStateDiagram]
.Export State Diagram
image::developer-guide/ExportStateDiagram.png[]

As seen in the figure, it is only possible to revert the state i.e. from Non-empty State to Empty State, by externally
deleting the file.

Additionally, if `export` is issued when there is an existing _study_plan.csv_, the current file will be overwritten.


==== Design Considerations

*Writing and Reading Issues*

It is possible that the user has the _study_plan.csv_ file open while attempting to export data. The only known solution is
for the user to close the file and issuing the command again.

'''

=== Undo Feature

==== Overview

The undo feature allows for the prior state of a `courseBook` to be saved and loaded from when needed.

==== Implementation

The undo mechanism is facilitated by the `ModelManager` and the `LogicManager`.

The function `saveCourseBook()`, which composes the `storage` object, is used to save the previous state of the `coursebook`
in the file _backup_coursebook.json_ when a new command is executed.

The function `undoCourseBook()`, implemented by the `ModelManager`, reads from the file _backup_coursebook.json_ and restores
the data by calling `setCourseBook()`

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo mechanism behaves at each step:

Step 1. The user starts up the application.

image::developer-guide/UndoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user issues the command `module delete CS2103T`. The previous state of the course book is stored into the file
at `backup_coursebook.json` by `saveCourseBook()`. This state still contains the module CS2103T.

image::developer-guide/UndoState1.png[]

NOTE: When the `undo` command is executed, the state of the `courseBook` is not saved.

Step 3. The user issues the command `undo`. The file at `backup_coursebook.json` is read from and loaded as the main `courseBook`
to be read from.

image::developer-guide/UndoState2.png[]

Step 4. The `backupCourseBook` becomes the main `courseBook` and another instance of `courseBook` will be created as its
backup if another command is issued.

image::developer-guide/UndoState3.png[]

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::developer-guide/UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

*How undo executes*

* Option 1 (current choice): Saves the entire course book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* Option 2: Individual command knows how to undo/]] by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the module being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

NOTE: While it is recognised that Option 1 may have performance issues in terms of memory, the actual implementation
of the feature is unlikely to cause any memory issues. This is due to the fact that modules, requirements and other data
users would require are limited to a degree which will not require large memory allocation.

'''

=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging.
The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
